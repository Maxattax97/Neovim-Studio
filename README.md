Neovim Studio is a project that seeks to turn the tried-and-true text editor into a full blown IDE that competes with (and surpasses) the capabilities of modern IDE's like Visual Studio.

### Goals

+ Implement every feature provided by modern IDE's (minus the graphical interface [for now ;)]).
+ Maintain considerable speed over modern IDE's.
+ Provide significantly larger language support than modern IDE's.
+ Implement all plugins that could be considered _ubiquitous_ by pre-existing Vim/Neovim users.
+ Favor the "common case" in controls, themes, and other configurations.
+ To be the flagship or "go-to" IDE amongst Linux users.
